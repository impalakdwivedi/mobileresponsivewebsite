# mobileresponsivewebsite
It is an attempt to make a website responsive on mobile as well.
By adding <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> to all our tags will make our page adjust accordingly on the mobile as well. A good responsive website is the one that can open on desktop as well as mobile version.
There are other few modifications that you can do to make your image adjust accordingly like switching from <img src="img_girl.jpg" style="width:100%;"> to <img src="img_girl.jpg style=max-width:100%;height:auto;>".
The text size can be set with a "vw" unit, which means the "viewport width".

That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window:
<h1 style="font-size:10vw">Hello World</h1>
