The feautures of this website include taking full advantage of modern web technologies, namely HTML5 and CSS3, applying them step-by-step to each component of your web content to make the website responsive.
Breakpoints are when your responsive site reaches a certain viewing width and calls new styles for that width
The standard breakpoints are tablet and mobile, and their respective orientations
It is always important to check your site at points that aren’t the default to create a truly cohesive experience.
Make sure that your custom breakpoints don’t conflict with any of the standard breakpoints.
RWD is meant in an attempt to be future proof, so spending to much time focusing on present devices is not good practice
Ensuring the viewing experience remains at a consistent quality level will make you look like an expert to clients.
CSS Overflow
The overflow property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.
The overflow property has the following values:
visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary
